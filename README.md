# MOOC.fi Python Programming Introduction

This repository includes every solution that I have made to the programming exercises in the MOOC.fi Python Programming 2022 Course.
These solutions were all made using the TestMyCode extension on VSCode/VSCodium.
All of these solutions should work in 2022, but the exercises are subject to change and these solutions are not guaranteed to work in future versions.
Solutions given from MOOC.fi after submission may not necessarily be the same as the solutions I am providing in this repository.
